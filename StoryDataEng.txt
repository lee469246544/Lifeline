Hello?
Is this thing working?
Can anyone read me?
<<choice [[Who is this?|whois]]>> | <<choice [[I read you.|message received]]>>


:: whois
<<silently>><<set $toldname = 1>><<endsilently>>
Right, right, sorry. Should've started with that.
I was just excited to get a response to my signal.
My name's Taylor. I was a... an astronaut on board the starship Varia.
<<choice [[The Varia?|Variainfo]]>> | <<choice [["Was?" What happened?|whathappened]]>>


:: Variainfo
The Varia was a transport ship. Nothing fancy. Crew of less than a dozen.
We were en route to Tau Ceti IV and, as far as I knew, everything was going fine!
We were set to dock in six more days.
But then... I don't know what happened. We crashed on some moon.
I don't know where.
<<choice [[How do you not know?|dontknow]]>> | <<choice [[Try using a map.|usemap]]>>


:: dontknow
<<silently>><<set $toldstudent = 1>><<endsilently>>
<<if $mapsuggest is 1>>Yeah, I seriously don't know.<<endif>>
Why don't I know? Why don't I have this whole sector memorized, like any astronaut worth a damn would?
Because I'm a STUDENT, okay?
My number came up in a lottery of science students, and I got to join this mission.
I was on board the Varia running zero-G experiments on rats and lichens and stuff, all right?
I was never, ever meant to be without a trained supervisor by my side at any time.
So it's safe to say that this crash landing wasn't covered anywhere in my student handbook.
<<choice [[Okay. Calm down.|calmdown]]>> | <<choice [[Whoa. Take it easy.|whoatakeiteasy]]>>


:: calmdown
Right. Sorry. As you can imagine, I'm pretty freaked out right now.
We covered a ton of different protocols in training, but this was never one of them.
But it's cool. It's cool. I just have to find the other survivors, and they'll know what to do.
Only...
[[delay 4s|nosurvivors]]


:: nosurvivors
...what if there ARE no other survivors?
What if I'm the only one who made it?
Aw, God, Captain Aya is probably dead. And all the others, too. Colby... dammit. Colby.
I just... what if I'm all alone out here?
<<choice [[Easy, now. Just breathe.|justbreathe]]>> | <<choice [[Want to talk about Colby?|talkColby]]>>


:: justbreathe
Right. You're right. The atmosphere is breathable, might as well breathe it.
I mean, it's like Colby said, more than once:
Don't waste time worrying about "what if," just concentrate on "what is."
So. Let's do that.
<<choice [[Okay. Where are you?|whereareyou]]>> | <<choice [[Are you hurt?|areyouallright]]>>


:: sorryaboutearlier
It's all good. Tensions are running pretty high. People are bound to say things they don't mean.
I'm glad to have someone to talk me through this. I have no idea what I'd do if you weren't here.
Okay. So. Let's deal with what we DO know, at this point.
<<choice [[Where are you?|whereareyou]]>> | <<choice [[Are you hurt?|areyouallright]]>>


:: message received
Oh, thank God! It's so good to have human contact!
It's been hours!
<<choice [[Who are you?|whois]]>> | <<choice [[What happened?|whathappened]]>>


:: whathappened
Our ship crashed on some moon. I have no idea where.
I managed to get to an escape pod, but I couldn't tell if anyone else made it into one.
My IEVA suit sensor tells me that the air here is breathable, at least, so that's nothing short of a miracle.
But I've got no food or water rations on me. The toolkit on the pod is about as basic as they come.
I managed to get the pod's mobile transmitter working, but -- lucky you -- you seem to be the only one in range of the signal.
Whoever and wherever you might be.
<<choice [[Are you all right?|areyouallright]]>> | <<choice [[Where are you?|whereareyou]]>>


:: StoryTitle
Lifeline 041115


:: usemap
<<silently>><<set $mapsuggest = 1>><<endsilently>>
Yeah, that'd be a fantastic plan, if it weren't for the tiny problem that I, and my escape pod, are right here...
...whereas the astromap room is still in the Varia.
Which, given the two separate plumes of black smoke to the south, is in AT LEAST two pieces, nowhere near me.
So you'll forgive me if "use a map" isn't at the very top of my "to do" list.
<<choice [[You seriously have no idea?|dontknow]]>> | <<choice [[Sorry. Are you all right?|areyouallright]]>>


:: whoatakeiteasy
"Easy" isn't exactly at the top of my list of ways to take it, at the moment.
I am marooned in deep space and -- if we're being honest -- I'm freaking the hell out!
<<choice [[It'll be okay. Calm down.|calmdown]]>> | <<choice [[Don't be a baby.|dontbeababy]]>>


:: dontbeababy
"Don't be a baby"?
Oh, and I suppose YOU get stranded on a desert moon every day, huh?
You wouldn't be much good on a crisis hotline, anyone ever tell you that?
I think I was doing better before I got this transmitter hooked up.
Just... I'm gonna take a break for a while. Try to assess the situation.
I'll call you when I'm ready to talk again, okay?
[[delay 30m|readytotalk]]


:: readytotalk
Okay, look. I hate to admit you're even a little bit right.
But sitting here feeling sorry for myself isn't going to get me rescued. So I guess it's time to take action.
Please, just... remember I'm scared out of my mind, okay?
I'm grateful to have any human contact at all, I really am, but... take it easy on me, all right?
<<choice [[Sorry about earlier.|sorryaboutearlier]]>> | <<choice [[Grow some thicker skin.|thickerskin]]>>


:: thickerskin
Damn. You've got the "tough" part of "tough love" down cold, but the rest could use some work.
Look, I'm going to keep this channel open...
...but only because having you on the other end of the line is better than bouncing my thoughts into the void.
Any help you can offer, well, that'd just be peachy.
<<choice [[Any idea where you are?|whereareyou]]>> | <<choice [[You all in one piece?|areyouallright]]>>


:: whereareyou
The only way I can answer that with any confidence is to say "stranded."
If you know where nowhere is, just look right in the middle of it, and you'll spot me.
<<if $toldname is 0>>My name's Taylor, by the way. Probably should've started with that.<<endif>>
The Varia was on a gentle elliptical path toward Tau Ceti IV.
I don't know whether we went off course, or by how much.
I was nowhere near the bridge when it all went down.
Colby, she... she shoved me into an escape pod and then went to see how she could help the others. That's just who she was.
I guess I blacked out in the pod, from shock or fear or something -- I don't know how long -- 
...and when I came to, I was here.
<<choice [[Describe "here."|describehere]]>> | <<choice [[Want to talk about Colby?|talkColby]]>>


:: StoryAuthor
Dave Justus


:: areyouallright
Let's see. My ship just crashed in the middle of nowhere.
No one is hailing on this frequency, and I don't see any survivors other than me...
...the least prepared person in existence for this sort of emergency!
But I got out of the whole mess with nothing more than a stubbed toe, so things are looking just peachy. 
Thanks for asking.
<<choice [[Sorry about the toe. Smartass.|sorrytoe]]>> | <<choice [["Least prepared"?|leastprepared]]>>


:: leastprepared
<<if $toldstudent is 0>>
Because... I'm a student, okay?
Not an astronaut. My number came up in a lottery of science students, and I got to join this mission.
I was on board the Varia running zero-G experiments on rats and lichens and stuff.
I was never, ever meant to be without a trained supervisor by my side at any time.
So it's safe to say that this crash landing wasn't covered anywhere in my student handbook.<<endif>>
I mean, this definitely wasn't on the exam in science class. And I was in Advanced Placement!
<<choice [[Oooh. Smart kid.|smartkid]]>> | <<choice [[Okay. So where are you now?|whereareyou]]>>


:: talkColby
Oh. Yeah, maybe that'd help.
Colby was... she was like the "mom" around the Varia.
The nicest, but also, I think, the smartest.
Not in a showy way, but in that way of, you know, if something broke, she'd know how to fix it.
(And yes, even on a multi-billion-dollar starship, half the time the answer is "duct tape.")
But Colby was sweet enough that her smarts never made anyone else feel stupid. I really appreciated that.
I know I'm hoping against hope, but I really hope Colby made it through this nightmare alive.
I mean, I hope EVERYONE did, obviously. But maybe I hope a little extra hard for her.
<<choice [[Thanks for sharing that.|thanksforsharing]]>> | <<choice [[Describe where you are now.|describehere]]>>


:: thanksforsharing
Hey, no, thanks for listening to me blather.
That actually felt normal. Like I was telling my new friend about my old friend.
Hey, if this all turns out for the best, maybe we can all go get coffee sometime. I'm buyin'.
Or, hell, if I make it out of this alive, I'll have earned something a lot stronger than coffee!
<<choice [[Sounds good!|coffeesoundsgood]]>> | <<choice [[Describe where you are now.|describehere]]>>


:: sorrytoe
Ha. Yeah, well. I've been told I use sarcasm as a weapon, and right now, I'm not armed with anything else.
So let's hope that if there's any sort of little green men waiting to jump out and attack me...
...they're vulnerable to ironic comments and eye-rolling.
<<if $toldname is 0>>Oh, hey, my name is Taylor, by the way. Probably should've led with that. Sorry.<<endif>>
Anyway. Why don't I tell you what I can see from here, maybe you can advise me on where to go.
[[describehere]]


:: smartkid
Yeah, right. Smart kid with a stubbed toe.
<<choice [[Sorry about the toe, Einstein.|sorrytoe]]>> | <<choice [[Cope. Where are you now?|whereareyou]]>>


:: deadendmountain
<<silently>><<set $boulderdayone = 1>><<endsilently>>
Damn! Looks like the path is blocked off.
I was tracing this shallow canyon, but I hit this huge boulder. Way too big to climb over.
What do you figure... should I look for some way around it, or head back to the crash?
<<choice [[Find a way around.|wayaround]]>> | <<choice [[Head back to the crash.|backtocrash]]>>


:: movetopeak
All right. I guess I have to start somewhere.
Hey, I, uh, I appreciate the advice. It's just good to have any sense of direction at all, out here.
Anyway... looks like this hike could take a while.
[[delay 60m|deadendmountain]]


:: gotopeak
You think? It's a lot farther away than the crash site.
I'm not sure I'll make it there before nightfall.
<<choice [[Better get moving, then.|movetopeak]]>> | <<choice [[Okay, head for the crash site.|gotocrash]]>>


:: describehere
All right, so, my escape pod came down in some kind of desert.
The ground is all cracked white rock. There's a huge white peak a few miles away.
Or, uh, kilometers, I guess. (They tried to get me to think metric for the trip, but some things are just hardwired.)
It's weirdly symmetrical, like it might not be a natural formation.
My IEVA suit's compass places the peak northeast, and then, in the opposite direction -- south and southwest, to be precise --
...are two funnels of black smoke from what I have to assume are two pieces of the Varia.
Best case scenario, it's ONLY in two pieces.
The crash sites look closer than the peak. What do you think I should do?
<<choice [[Check the crash.|gotocrash]]>> | <<choice [[Head for the peak.|gotopeak]]>>


:: saveyourenergy
Sure, sure. But I'm going to have to start heading in some direction, sooner or later.
Can't just stay here by the pod forever.
Look, let me tell you what I can see from here, maybe you can advise me on where to go.
[[describehere]]


:: backatflightdeck
I've got the Captain. It's funny, with her flight suit and everything, I guess...
...I don't know, I guess I just expected her to be heavier, or something.
But it's like she's just sort of... a shell, now. Like everything that made her who she was is just... gone.
I'm gonna go ahead and rig up a field stretcher with a Mylar blanket and duct tape. Easiest way to transport her.
I'll check in again when the two of us are back (once more) at the crew quarters.
[[delay 30m|backtoburycap]]


:: wayaround
Okay. I'll give it a shot. This is pretty rough terrain, though.
[[delay 40m|deadendforreal]]


:: backtocrash
Yeah, you know, I think that's probably the smart move.
I've gotta hope that some supplies made it through the crash intact.
I'd really rather not starve to death in the middle of the moon desert, if I can help it.
Anyway... this looks like it's gonna be a pretty long hike.
I'm gonna head south, and I'll let you know when I get there.
[[delay 120m|stillhikingcrash]]


:: gotocrash
Yeah, cool, that makes sense. There might be other survivors... fingers crossed.
(It's not actually possible to cross your fingers in an IEVA suit, but just take my word on it.)
Or at the very least, there should be some supplies I can use.
Okay, I'm headed south now. Looks like the smoke is at least an hour away. Or whatever the metric equivalent of an hour is.
I'll let you know once I'm there.
[[delay 60m|stillhikingcrash]]


:: coffeesoundsgood
Yeah, anything sounds good after the Varia's rations!
Speaking of which, I'm gonna want to find something to eat and drink before long.
I have this theory that if I just built an intersection here, competing Starbucks would magically appear on at least two of the corners.
But I'd hate to do all that work just to be proven wrong.
<<choice [[Save your energy.|saveyourenergy]]>> | <<choice [[Describe your surroundings.|describehere]]>>


:: justkeepmovingcrewcapdead
Right. That... that makes sense.
The longer I spend staring at them instead of trying to figure a way out of this mess, the closer I get to joining them.
God, that's the most morbid thought I've ever had to think.
[[branchingcorridor]]


:: gogetcap
Yeah... you know you're living right when a half-hour hike in an IEVA suit to pick up a corpse and drag it a half hour back sounds like a vacation.
I promise you... THIS was not in the training protocols.
Anyway. Off I go.
[[delay 30m|backatflightdeck]]


:: backtoburycap
So after a depressing trudge across a barren wasteland, we arrive once more at a crewless crew quarters.
My life has become bad middle-school poetry.
I'm going to get the rest of the graves dug and inter the Captain and the crew, which I think will be a really good thing.
Just to have some sense of closure, you know?
I want to come up with a few words to say over each of them. I'm gonna take a little private time while I work.
I'll get back to you in a bit.
[[delay 60m|everybodyburied]]


:: keepitforcap
"Keep it together"?! Really?
I'm coated in the blood of a woman who, for all intents and purposes, I just killed -- on YOUR advice, by the way --
and the most comforting thing you can offer is "keep it together"?
How about maybe go screw yourself. That's MY advice.
[[delay 15m|goscrewyourself]]


:: goscrewyourself
Hey. Uh... sorry about that.
Emotions are running a little high on this end.
The truth is, you're right. I DO need to keep it together if I have a prayer of getting rescued.
The, uh... it's awful that the Captain died, but it happens. All the blood she'd lost, it may have been a mercy.
So. Me, I'm alive, let's figure out where to go from here.
<<choice [[Just keep moving forward.|movingonforcap]]>> | <<choice [[Never forget her.|dontforgetcap]]>>


:: dontforgetcap
No, of course not. I could never forget her.
But if I'm going to keep the Captain's memory alive, I'm gonna have to survive myself.
So... I've got a beacon, got a turret. Need power, food, and water. Sounds easy enough, right? Sure.
I'm gonna head over and search the wreckage of the crew quarters now. I'll message you soon.
[[delay 30m|headingtocrewqs]]


:: deadendforreal
<<silently>><<set $deadenddayone = 1>><<endsilently>>
Listen, there's just no way around this thing.
Not enough footholds to get even a few feet up it. Or "meters" up it, whatever.
These canyon walls look like nothing but loose rock, too.
And -- surprise, surprise -- as a science fair champ, I'm pretty much the definition of an "indoor kid."
I don't think I'm cut out for rock climbing.
<<choice [[Might as well head back.|backtocrash]]>> | <<choice [[Give climbing a try.|rockclimbing]]>>


:: stillhikingcrash
Holy crap. It's a lot further than it looked. My legs feel like Jell-O, and I'm maybe halfway there.
[[delay 4s|jello]]


:: refreshed
Believe it or not, I actually feel better after sleeping a little.
I'm going to get the rest of the graves dug and inter the crew, which I think will be a really good thing.
Just to have some sense of closure, you know?
I want to come up with a few words to say over each of them. I'm gonna take a little private time while I work.
I'll get back to you in a bit.
[[delay 60m|crewburied]]


:: pullitout
Okay, okay, good deal, I'll just
OH MAN now there's way more blood than before! How do I, you know, stanch the bleeding?
Stanch? Staunch? I don't even know the right word!
Oh man, please stop bleeding Captain Aya, please, I'm gonna, I'm gonna look for gauze or something.
I don't know. Oh man. Oh man.
[[delay 15m|capdidntmakeit]]


:: capdidntmakeit
<<silently>><<set $capalive = 0>><<endsilently>>
She... she didn't make it.
Captain Aya is dead.
<<choice [[I am so sorry.|sorryforcap]]>> | <<choice [[Keep it together!|keepitforcap]]>>


:: sorryforcap
This is... just the worst. The Captain was the first person I met at Mission Control.
She just made me feel like part of the team, you know? Effortlessly.
That was her thing, she just knew how to get people working smoothly together. That's what made her such a great leader.
I didn't... I didn't think twice about putting my life in her hands.
[[delay 4s|capsgone]]


:: capsgone
And then when her life was in MY hands, I just... watched it bleed out.
I lost her. What... what do I even do now?
<<choice [[Just keep moving forward.|movingonforcap]]>> | <<choice [[Never forget her.|dontforgetcap]]>>


:: movingonforcap
Yeah. You're right. There's nothing for it but to just keep pushing ahead.
Find things to do, keep body and mind active.
So... I've got a beacon, got a turret. Need power, food, and water. Sounds easy enough, right? Sure.
I'm gonna head over and search the wreckage of the crew quarters now. I'll message you soon.
[[delay 30m|headingtocrewqs]]


:: headingtocrewqs
Okay. Okay. Well, this wasn't unexpected, but still.
I, uh... I found some of the crew.
It's... oh, man. Hang on.
[[delay 2m|threwup]]


:: threwup
Sorry about that. I had to go be sick behind some moon rocks.
So, there were a few crew members who were apparently pretty near where the Varia's hull split.
I can't... I can't tell who they were, or how many.
They're all sort of fused, to the metal or, uh, to each other.
And we, I don't know, we might've lost some crew when we lost pressure.
[[delay 2s|deadcrew]]


:: deadcrew
Behind the sealed door to the rear quarters, though, I... I found the rest of the crew.
Antoine, Trotter, Colby, Adair. All dead. All of them, just... dead.
I... I don't think I can do this. Knowing that all of them, every one of them... I just...
<<choice [[Honor the dead.|burythemall]]>> | <<choice [[Just keep moving.|justkeepmovingcrewcapdead]]>>


:: burythemall
<<silently>><<set $startedburialtalk = 1>><<endsilently>>
Yeah. You're right. I should... bury them, or something, huh?
There's got to be, like, a spade or some kind of... something to dig with.
Man, this is gonna take some work. Maybe I should keep exploring the rest of the ship, see if I can find some rations first.
I'm pretty much running on fumes, here.
<<choice [[Makes sense. Keep exploring.|branchingcorridor]]>> | <<choice [[Dig now, explore later.|dignow]]>>


:: dignow
Okay. Okay. I guess you're right.
These are good people, they deserve a proper memorial.
There's a... it's a piece of shielding that's mostly broken loose.
The way it twisted when the Varia came apart, it's got kind of a scoop end to it. I'll work with that.
Listen, this is gonna take a while. I'll get back to you in a bit, okay?
[[delay 30m|hardground]]


:: hardground
Whatever the ground is made of... it does NOT want to be dug.
I've got... one grave. Pretty shallow.
Plus, it occurred to me I should probably go get Captain Aya's body... she'd want to be buried with the rest of her crew.
Might go do that now. Hiking and hauling actually sounds preferable to digging.
<<choice [[Sure. Go get the Captain.|gogetcap]]>> | <<choice [[Probably better to keep digging.|betterkeepdigging]]>>


:: betterkeepdigging
Seriously? Are you trying to kill me?
I'm all about paying respects, but I'm not looking for the next grave I dig to be my own.
This is hard work, and I'm burning calories I haven't eaten yet, and maybe never will.
<<choice [[All right. Rest a while.|takeabreak]]>> | <<choice [[Fine, go get the Captain.|gogetcap]]>>


:: takeabreak
Yeah. I think that's a great idea.
Just a little catnap.
Or, you know, the metric equivalent. A chinchilla-nap.
[[delay 30m|refreshed]]


:: rockclimbing
I really... aw, screw it.
Okay. I've come this far, no sense in giving up now. Here goes nothing!
[[delay 30m|taylorfalls]]


:: jello
Great. And now all I can think about is how much I want Jell-O.
[[delay 60m|arriveatcrash]]


:: arriveatcrash
Okay. At long last, I'm in sight of the Varia. Or what's left of it, at any rate.
It seems to have cracked hard once it hit atmosphere.
Like I figured, it came down in two major chunks...
...with a ton of scattered debris thrown around just to make the whole scene look terrifying and post-apocalyptic.
(In case anyone asks, it's working; I'm appropriately terrified.)
Looks like the flight deck came down pretty far from the crew quarters. Where do you figure I should go first?
<<choice [[Look for the crew.|checkcrewqs]]>> | <<choice [[Check the flight deck.|totheflightdeck]]>>


:: totheflightdeck
<<silently>><<set $frontofship = 1>><<endsilently>>
All right. It's gonna take me a few minutes to sort through the wreckage.
A lot of the heat shielding was stripped on entry, but it seems to have taken the worst of the damage.
Most of the instrumentation looks surprisingly intact.
Let me poke through this mess...
[[delay 5m|defensesandbeacon]]


:: defensesandbeacon
Hot damn! We're in business!
(Well, I mean, if you keep in mind that most businesses fail before they ever really get off the ground.)
So, let's play a round of Good News/Bad News.
Good news: I found the ship's distress beacon, and from what I can tell, it's totally intact!
Which means, hey, maybe I won't be stuck here forever.
More good news: One of the defense turrets is still operational.
Yes, that means that three of them AREN'T, but there's only one of me to operate a turret, so in this case the math works out great.
So that means if the little green men DO come poking around, I'll have more than a smarmy pop-culture reference to defend myself with.
But now for the bad news: I've got no power for either the beacon or the guns. The reactor came down with the back half of the ship.
I'm quite certain we didn't pack any extension cords long enough to bridge that distance...
...and even if the reactor were right here, I seriously doubt it's in good enough shape to power much of anything at the moment.
So... I'm going to keep hunting in this end of the Varia and see if I can dig up some kind of alternate power source.
[[delay 10m|captainsbody]]


:: captainsbody
Oh... oh, no. I hadn't found any of the crew up here near the flight deck, but... I just found Captain Aya.
There's just... so much blood, I wouldn't have thought
OH HOLY HELL she's not dead! The Captain's not dead!
She's got a huge piece of metal through her side, like a, like a support strut or something... it doesn't matter what it is!
What do I do? Should I... do I pull it out?
Oh, man, she's really bleeding. Oh, man.
<<choice [[Pull it out!|pullitout]]>> | <<choice [[Leave it in.|leaveitin]]>>


:: leaveitin
Okay. Good plan. Who knows what kind of damage I might do if I yanked it out?
It's... the wound isn't really actively bleeding right now, but her breath is really shallow and kind of... rattling?
Oh, man. I think there's a good chance this thing pierced her lung.
Crap, crap, crap. What am I supposed to do?
<<choice [[Look for a medkit.|lookformeds]]>> | <<choice [[Make her comfortable.|makehercomfy]]>>


:: lookformeds
Yes. Okay. Great plan. There should be a medkit on the flight deck. Just gotta find it.
[[delay 1m|nomedshere]]


:: nomedshere
The damn forward med supply cabinet is scorched over. I'd need a crowbar and a power drill...
...and with my luck, I'd injure myself so badly that I'd have to use all the contents on myself if I ever DID get it open.
There's another med locker in the rear of the ship, by the crew quarters. I've gotta go for that one.
[[delay 30m|medsupplyhunt]]


:: medsupplyhunt
Okay. Okay. I'm at the wreckage of the crew quarters.
And, well, this wasn't totally unexpected, but still.
I, uh... I found some of the crew.
It's... oh, man. Hang on.
[[delay 2m|threwupcapalive]]


:: movethecaptain
Are you sure? I mean, I think I can get her here -- maybe set up some kind of stretcher --
but I'm worried that if I move her too much, the bleeding will start up again.
Although... it's gonna take a lot longer to get this pod to cover that distance...
<<choice [[Move the Captain.|movethecap2]]>> | <<choice [[Move the pod.|movethepod]]>>


:: movethecap2
All right. Time is of the essence, after all.
Maybe, like I said, I can rig up a field stretcher. Mylar blanket, duct tape... yeah, I can scrounge stuff, make that work.
Okay, I'll be back, and then I'll get the Captain sealed up in this pod!
Wish us both luck, would you?

I didn't... I didn't think twice about putting my life in her hands.

Okay! Good News/Bad News time again.
Bad news: No medkit that I could find. I could get into the cabinet just fine, but the kit was gone.
Someone must have taken it for something, and not put it back before the crash. So it's probably still around, somewhere.
But! Good news: The Varia had two medical stasis pods on board.
One is so much scrap metal now (bad news), but the other is still intact, and all functions have a green light!
How do I know, you might ask?
Because I also found a portable generator!
(And then I did a little portable generator dance.)
It's small, but it'll keep the stasis pod running for days.
And the pod might not be able to heal the Captain, but it'll keep her wounds in check and keep that lung from getting any worse.
It's gonna be a pain in the ass to haul the pod and the ginny all the way back to the Captain, though.
You think I should bring her here, or try to rig this thing up to move it to her?

Hot damn! We're in business!
(Well, I mean, if you keep in mind that most businesses fail before they ever really get off the ground.)
So, let's play a round of Good News/Bad News.
Good news: I found the ship's distress beacon, and from what I can tell, it's totally intact!
Which means, hey, maybe I won't be stuck here forever.
More good news: One of the defense turrets is still operational.
Yes, that means that three of them AREN'T, but there's only one of me to operate a turret, so in this case the math works out great.
So that means if the little green men DO come poking around, I'll have more than a smarmy pop-culture reference to defend myself with.
But now for the bad news: I've got no power for either the beacon or the guns. The reactor came down with the back half of the ship.
I'm quite certain we didn't pack any extension cords long enough to bridge that distance...
...and even if the reactor were right here, I seriously doubt it's in good enough shape to power much of anything at the moment.
So... I'm going to keep hunting in this end of the Varia and see if I can dig up some kind of alternate power source.

<<if $capburied is 1>>The Captain, too.<<endif>>
<<if $ginny is 1 and $power is "pod">>The stasis pod is humming along nicely, keeping the Captain alive and well. Or at least alive.
Still, as long as the ginny is powering the pod, there's no way for me to fire up either the distress beacon or the gun turret.
I'm not so worried about the turret -- I seriously doubt there's anything else living on this rock besides me...
...but without the beacon, how will anyone know I'm here and alive? How will I ever get rescued?
After everything... I can't unplug the Captain for my own sake.
Can I?
<<choice [[Keep powering the pod.|powerpodcapalive]]>> | <<choice [[Power the beacon.|powerbeaconcapalive]]>>
<<elseif $ginny is 1 and $power is "none">>I've got the generator that I found alongside the stasis pod.
Now that the, uh... now that the Captain is gone, I guess I've got a couple of options for what to do with it.
I can use it to fire up either the distress beacon, or the gun turret.
I'm slightly less worried about the turret -- I kind of doubt there's anything else living on this rock besides me...
...but the beacon is my only way of letting someone know I'm here and alive.
What do you think?
<<choice [[Power the gun turret.|powerturretcapdead]]>> | <<choice [[Power the beacon.|powerbeaconcapdead]]>>
<<elseif $ginny is 0 and $frontofship is 1>>It'd be great to get the distress beacon up and pinging, or to have the gun turret operational, just in case...

I... God, I guess I really have to consider that, don't I?
I mean, if I don't signal someone that I'm here, then the Captain's dead when the ginny runs dry...
...and I'm dead when I'm out of rations.
(And before you even THINK of suggesting cannibalism, just know that the idea is off the table. Figuratively and literally.)
Captain Aya was always about using hard logic to make her decisions. I guess that's what we've come down to.

The intruder keep on intruding after that, I'll be able to switch to manual, or just let the autogun finish them off.

Tau Ceti is down now, and I don't mind telling you, it's darker than a goth kid's journal, and colder than the prom queen's shoulder.
So, uh, here are my options, as I see 'em.
I can stay here in the wreckage -- although without power to the ship, I can't reseal any door I've opened.
So I'll have a roof over my head, sure, but I'll be exposed to the elements.
Or, I can head around to the rear of the ship and pitch a tent near the reactor engine...
...which is nice and toasty warm -- I can tell from the squiggly heat lines it's sending off into the night.
(You like that science-speak? "Squiggly heat lines?" That's some advanced-level terminology, right there.)
Only problem there is, there's radiation involved in that engine, and I'm not precisely sure whether it's enough to roast me overnight.
So, would you mind doing a little research for me?
If I get about 150 rads overnight, will that kill me? My IEVA suit sensor tells me that's about what it's giving off.
Can you look that up and let me know whether it'd toast my marshmallows? Thanks.

So, uh, hopefully you had a chance to look that up, because it's getting really, just stupidly cold here.

From up here, I can tell it's a much smaller ship than the Varia -- it's what I think they call a caravel-class vessel.
It would've had half a dozen crew, tops, making quick runs with minimal armament.
Minimal defenses.
What is it doing here? How long has it been here?
The engine looks like it was just... SHEARED from the rest of the ship. Did they collide with space debris, maybe?

There's some writing that isn't too legible... looks like Chinese characters? Or Japanese? There's too much paint missing to be sure.

So, I can tell you this just from here: The instrument panel are smashed to splinters. And then the splinters were smashed to splinters.

(There may legitimately be no tomorrow. Fun thought.)
But the bottle is almost empty. It would make a nice maraca, but there are only three pills in it.
I'm not here to judge, but someone on this ship must've had a pretty serious problem.

If and when those disappear, I'll have to navigate by landmarks like the caravel site and, past that, the enormous crater.
If my luck holds, I'll make it back to the Varia before sunset.

Something strange to report. I've been keeping close tabs on it, because I didn't want to say anything until I was absolutely sure.
My IEVA suit's compass is 100% useless.
I got to the rim of a small crater, a little ways back, and elected just to walk its perimeter.
But the compass didn't alter itself in concert with my orientation.
It just spun at random, or not at all -- it had nothing to do with which way I was facing.
<<if $compassweird is 1>>I mean, back when I was inside the caravel wreckage, the compass was acting all weird...

I thought, once I got away from there, everything would go back to normal.
<<elseif $compassweird is 0>>In fact, I'm not sure it's been working properly ever since I was back at the caravel wreckage.
I wasn't really watching it closely back then, but looking back, I'm more and more certain of it.
Could whatever brought the ship down have played havoc with its polarity somehow, too?
And more importantly, why wouldn't it have gone back to normal once I got away from the crash site?<<endif>>
I could still keep moving toward the peak, just navigating by sight, obviously...
...but this is a little bit troubling, in consideration of the return trip.
The winds have been really calm for the last hour or so.
If I wanted to trace my footsteps back the way I just came, this would be the time to make that decision.

Unfortunately, I can't seem to get any closer to the stupid peak to figure out what's making that stupid glow.

You say something?
<<if $zombierats is 0>>WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
Oh God. Okay. Oh God. I'm awake. I'm awake.
Uh, there was this... I don't know, this, like, scuttling type noise. Coming from behind me, out in the corridor.
And I turned around. And, and... I saw something. Something moving.
Something GLOWING. Glowing green.
Lots of little somethings, actually. Close to the ground. Glowing, and moving, and scuttling.
Which are three things that are way, way high on my list of stuff I was NOT EXPECTING TO SEE tonight, if I'm being honest.
<<elseif $zombierats is 1>>I swear I just... I totally just heard that weird scuttling noise again. Like from before.
And I turned around in the chair, and I saw it again: Little glowing, green, moving things in the main corridor.<<endif>>
That's just... I mean, I didn't ACTUALLY hear anything. Or see anything. Right?
It's just my exhausted, terrified mind playing tricks on me. "Space Madness," like in that old Ren & Stimpy cartoon. Remember that?

Wow, is that the last thing I want to do.
Go traipsing around in the cold and the dark, looking for something that isn't here to begin with?
It's not like glow rods grow on trees. And even if they did, it's not like there are any trees on this moon.

I've been everywhere I can get to inside this ship, and I didn't find a thing.
No noises, no movement, no glowing green anything.

And probably scaring myself silly yet again. But next time I'll know better than to go looking for monsters under the bed.

Ha! According to this one's code, it was packaged four months from now. Obviously a misprint.
But it robs me of a clue in my very amateur detective work... I have one less way of knowing when this ship was supplied.

I have to hope that my inability to get to it yesterday was just a combination of exhaustion and optical illusion.
With food in my belly and the full day ahead of me, I'm liking my odds a lot better today.

Look, between you and me, it's not as if I don't have my doubts, too.
I nearly killed myself trying to reach that peak yesterday. Maybe I should quit while I'm ahead.
There's a tiny part of me that thinks I should just go back to the Varia.
It's a known quantity -- and since I'm surrounded by the unknown on all sides, the familiar is nothing to sneeze at.
But something is... I don't know, COMPELLING me to go check out the peak.

Stuck my head out of the caravel and caught what was, honestly, one of the most impressive sunrises I've ever witnessed.
(That sun being Tau Ceti and not good ol' Sol, but still, I'm gonna go ahead and count it.)
So, first of all, let's just be impressed that I was up and at 'em before first light -- that hasn't happened in... ever?
And second, I should mention that I could see that weird green corona around the peak again, that sort of soft glow.
The light -- like the shape of the peak itself -- is just a few degrees away from natural-looking. It weirds me out.
("Weirds me out" is the technical, scientific term for it. Look it up. From the Latin for "Icky yucky squicky.")
<<if $compassweird is 1>>Oh, and last but not least, my IEVA suit's compass is still acting all icky yucky squicky.

It doesn't change correctly in concert with my movements. Sometimes it just spins, other times it stays firmly in place.
Maybe there's something weird about this wreckage that affects the polarity... I don't know.<<endif>>
I guess I don't REALLY need it for hiking to the peak; so long as I've got line of sight, it shouldn't be a problem to get there.

All right. I'm heading north. Weird-ass peak or bust. I'll message you after a while.
[[delay 90m|stillpeakbound]]

Okay. I reached this point yesterday, having detoured around the rim of a little crater.
This was where I was realizing that my IEVA suit compass was all screwy, even though I was probably five miles from the wreck.

And that's still the case today. The suit compass is nuttier than two squirrels in a winter food hoarding competition.

Hey, all right. This should almost be fun!
(Maybe I should put "fun" in quotes. It's a pretty nerdy version of "fun," if we're being honest.)
The medkit has a couple of needles in it, so that's easy enough.
I've done this before with a bowl of water, but it's not like I'm going to balance one of those while I'm hiking all day...
...but really, the important thing is just that the compass face is able to float, frictionless, while it spins.
So instead I'm gonna do a variation, where the compass face is balanced on, like, a pushpin or a brad. Something like that.
Of course, the most important part of making any compass is finding a magnet -- preferably, a rare earth magnet --
but fortunately, up in the flight deck there's whole bank of computers that aren't using their hard drives right now!
A little bit of gentle disassembly (by which I mean, I'm gonna smash the living crap out of 'em with whatever's handy)...

It may not be pretty, but it seems to actually work.
By which I mean, it points toward the peak and tells me that's north -- which is better than my suit compass can do.

So as long as I can keep an eye on it, it can't go anywhere. (In theory, anyway.)

I guess, in the absence of nylon ropes and carabiners, a few shallow divots in the rock is as good as it's gonna get.

Whatever's approaching the peak right now, though... they're as big as I am.
Maybe that just means they're humans...

Some sort of native creature that sees me as a threat.
Or, worse... as a meal.

Could their National Space Administration really have covered this up? And WHY? What...

I don't know what, exactly, it's controlling... but there's really no answer to that question that'll ease my mind.
The room itself isn't very large -- large enough to stand up in, and move around a little, and that's about it.
But in banks on the walls... there are computer systems.
Functioning computer systems.
There are brand names I recognize, a sort of mix-and-match patchwork of monitors and CPUs.
There are even a couple of chairs in front of the computers...
...clearly taken from some old starship flight deck and repurposed here, to build a freaking workstation.
On the moon.
This all must be salvaged parts from ships. The computers, the chained generators, the wiring...
Oh. Yeah. That's the other thing. The wiring.
There's TONS of it. Bunched and bundled. And it all leads out of the computer banks and up, into a hole in the room's ceiling.
And from there, who knows where?

I heard the echo, bouncing off these rock walls, before I even heard the source.
And I was looking around, trying to figure out where that scuttling sound was coming from...
...and I saw this faint green glow, near the floor.
And it took a second, but then it resolved itself into... I swear, it was a bunch of little pairs of eyes.
And as I'm trying to process that, one of... of WHATEVER they were...
...brushed against my leg.
It didn't hurt me. It just kinda bounced right off and kept running, with the rest of them, deeper into the mountain.
But... this means... I'm not alone in here.

...and because of me, the odds are really good that she's going to make a full (if slow) recovery. Thank God.

Now the ramp door is safely sealed, and a full-vessel scan turned up no extraterrestrial stowaways...

There's talk of calling in some sort of nuclear strike on the whole damn rock.
I'm sure that's above my pay grade, but if for some reason I DO get a vote...

It went from normal rat squeaks to this, aahhh, this... it's like a SHRIEKING. It's painful!
Seriously, it's making the fillings in my teeth vibrate!

Now, if the aliens have host bodies AND -- with this rescue ship -- a fully functioning, spacefaring vessel?
One that isn't confined to this moon? One that can LEAVE here, and bring those thousands of alien parasites ANYWHERE?

or anything else that would make an observer think that these rats weren't fully in control of their own bodies.
But seeing the level of integration that the parasite had into Wildboy's muscles and nerves...
...I'm CERTAIN that the E.T. was piloting my rat around.

Yeah, I sure thought so too. Super-exciting.

Flee WHERE? There's nowhere to run. They've got me cornered in this control room.
I can't outmaneuver them. I can't win.
Oh, my God... this is it, isn't it? I'm gonna die, right here in this room, at the hands of the Varia crew!
They're going to infect me with whatever the hell their little parasite creature is...
and I AM GOING TO DIE.
Why won't they all stop SCREAMING?!

:: stoplookingateyes
You don't understand. You're not really hearing me.
This is the first time since the crash that I'm not panicked about anything and everything.
Whatever happens next... it's what's SUPPOSED to happen.
All of this: the Varia crashing, me finding the peak... all of it was meant to take place, to bring me to this moment.
To this calm.
<<choice [[Okay. Sure. Stay calm.|surestaycalm]]>> | <<choice [[Screw calm. Get out of there!|screwcalm]]>>



:: whatdoyousee
Okay. There just... there aren't any words that are going to accurately capture everything I'm going through...
...so I'm just going to tell you facts, and I'll try not to hyperventilate or scream or anything, midway through.
The first thing I saw, when they walked in, was the American flag patch on the spacesuits.
There on the left shoulder, just like on my own suit. Stars and stripes forever.
The suits are kind of beaten up, kind of dusty -- like they've been through hell and back.
Or maybe not quite "and back" yet.
They're all wearing the dome helmets, with that basically opaque gold layer on the visor.
I know, I know, it's there to help filter out UV rays...
...but again, nothing screams "America!" more than viewing the whole world through a thin layer of gold, huh?

I'm sorry. I just... need a minute. I'm sorry.
[[delay 3m|whatdoyousee]]


:: nametagtime
I mean, seeing these spacesuits, they were just so comforting, they were just so familiar...
...they're just SO DAMN FAMILIAR.
<<if $capalive is 1 and $power is "pod">>I'm looking at four patches. Sewn onto four American uniforms. Four words in clear, legible, san serif font.
Antoine. Trotter. Adair. Colby.
<<else>>I'm looking at five patches. Sewn onto five American uniforms. Five words in clear, legible, san serif font.
Antoine. Trotter. Adair. Colby.

No... before, I might have run from this. But now I know that I need to be a part of this union.
I need this passenger, just as it needs me to play host.
[[surestaycalm]]


:: youmustgetaway
I know. I want to. I want to run.
But my legs feel so weak. I've been walking all over this moon for three days, on barely enough food to survive.
So much of me just wants to stop running. Just stay here with my friends.
<<choice [[Those are not still your friends.|notstillyourfriends1]]>> | <<choice [[Stop looking at their eyes.|stoplookingateyes]]>>


:: whoareyoutalkingto
Colby.
Or, the one with Colby's nametag.
Lifting off her helmet.
...Aw, no. No, dammit.
It's her. It really is her.
I was hoping, hoping that somehow these were just survivors from another shipwreck.
Just normal people who had chanced across the Varia, and who had taken the IEVA suits to protect them against the elements.
But no. It's really Colby.
It's really ALL of them. Helmets off.
Exactly the way I last saw them.
Except with blank, green, glowing eyes.

:: getoutoftherenow
And how, exactly, would you propose that I get out? There's exactly ONE exit...
<<if $capalive is 1 and $power is "pod">>...and exactly FOUR people (or whatever they become when they stop being people) between me and that exit.
<<else>>...and exactly FIVE people (or whatever they become when they stop being people) between me and that exit.<<endif>>
Mathematically speaking, I'd say my odds are precisely "screwed."
(In metric terms, that's "up poop creek, sans paddle.")
And now... oh. Oh, no. Oh, please stop.

Thank you. I do, I just, I do need a minute. I'm sorry.

:: notstillyourfriends1
I know. I KNOW they're not. But they look just like my friends.
The eyes are wrong, I know... but the longer I look at them, the more sense they make, too.
And there are... little marks around their mouths. Dark green scabs from... it looks like... claw marks of some sort.
Like something was struggling to... to climb inside their mouths.
